# Bamazon

### Bamazon is an Amazon-like storefront, which takes in orders from costumers and deplete stock from the store's inventory.

## How it works

1. The app prompts users with two messages:

   - Enter the product ID you'd like to purchase from 1-10
   - How many would you like to buy?

2. User's input will then contact the bamazon database
3. User can also view the information of product that matches their selected ID and quantity
4. Total price of the order is calculated
